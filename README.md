# Next.js 15 App Router: Dynamic import in layout.js causes unexpected behavior

This repository demonstrates an unexpected behavior in Next.js 15's App Router when using dynamic imports within a `layout.js` file.  The issue arises when attempting to dynamically import components or modules that depend on the route parameters in a way that might not be supported by Next.js's new file-system-based routing.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to different routes. You will notice the unexpected behavior, which is explained below.

## Expected Behavior

The dynamic import should resolve correctly based on the route parameters and render the corresponding component.

## Actual Behavior

The dynamic import fails or behaves unexpectedly in certain scenarios. This often results in an error message, rendering nothing, or incorrect display of content. 

## Bug and Solution

The `layout.js` file contains the bug, which is in the way the dynamic import is handled.
The `layoutSolution.js` provides a potential solution that shows a possible workaround for this issue.
